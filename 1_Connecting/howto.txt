1. Connect with your VPN of choice if you are working from a remote connection or from outside 
of the network that your HPC cluser exists on.

2. Simply ssh into your HPC
    a. This will typically place on a login node, which is a low resource space where you can do
       some light testing and typicall submit jobs to a WLM (workload manager), like Slurm.

    b. Example: ssh <your username>@<your domain name or network IP>
                ssh tsb31@h2p.crc.pitt.edu

3. Note that you have entered into a secure shell connection with your HPC cluster
    a. Note that we are on a Linux-based system, for many HPC environments this will be
       RedHat Enterprise Linux

    b. Note any network attached storage that you/your group has access to.

    c. Note our .bashrc file and how we can modify this to do configure some basic settings
       and elements that we would like to run whenever we log in.

    d. Note the module system and how it will let us search for and install software that our
       HPC admins have approved.
