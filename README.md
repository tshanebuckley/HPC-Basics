# HPC-Basics
Small tutorial on some areas of interest for working on an HPC environment.


## How To Use this small tutorial
It is recommended to walk through this repo as a group with some local expert (programmer, senior user, PI, etc...). The first four modules should
be completed in order. After these introductory items, following modules may be skipped or done in any order (unless the howto.txt recommends otherwise).

If you are the proctor of this small introduction, it is recommended that you fork this repo and modify it to suite your local site's needs.
