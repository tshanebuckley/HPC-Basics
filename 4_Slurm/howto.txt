First, lets load R as we have done for git and rclone.

Note that loading R requires loading a gcc compiler first:

module load gcc
--then--
module load r

Secondly, lets take a look at our r script and disect it a bit.

Lets make our job submission script executable:

chmod 775 slurm_submit.R

Note that chmod lets us change the read/write permissions of a file along with letting
us make is executable.

Lets add our shebang to our script:

Use the command "which Rscript" and past the results at the top of our file with the leading '#!'.

Lastly, lets run it!

You can see your jobs using the command: squeue -u $USER

After our job is finished running, lets check out our log file.

Congrats! You just ran your first job using Slurm!
