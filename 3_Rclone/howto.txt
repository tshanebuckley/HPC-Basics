What is rclone? Well, it's basically a peice of software that is designed to allow you to connect to, manage, 
and access remote and cloud resources from a local machine. Lets try it out.

1. Make sure our HPC has rclone as a module (think back to our git example).

2. Load rclone.

3. Make sure rclone loaded.

4. Now we can configure rclone. It actually has a nice cli (command line interface) that mostly walks you
   through setting up a remote resource. 

   Use the command "rclone config" to get started.
   We will now go through setting up a new remote, using SharePoint as our example.

   a. Type 'n' for 'new remote' and hit enter

   b. Name your remote 'sharepoint'

   c. Type '23' for OneDrive and hit enter.

   d. Hit enter twice to skip through 'client_id' and 'client_secret' settings.

   e. Hit enter one more time to skip 'advanced config'

   f. Type 'n' and hit enter to skip autoconfig (since we are on a remote machine).

   g. Your guide should now show you how to get your result for setting up your remote connection
      and share said result for finishing up the connection.

   h. Paste in the shared result and hit enter.

   i. Find your sharepoint instance and configure it.

   j. Finalize your set up.

   k. Type 'q' and hit enter to exit rclone config

5. Mount your data:

   a. Make a directory to mount your data to:
      mkdir mnt

   b. Mount your data:
      rclone mount sharepoint:/ mnt --daemon --vfs-cache-mode full

   c. Look around your mounted just like it was on your filesystem!

   d. To unmount:
      fusermount -u mnt
